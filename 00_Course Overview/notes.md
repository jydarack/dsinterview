# Course overview

I was first surprised to see that the course was only 4 hours long. But as with the TensorFlow 2 and Keras course, this doesn't include the time YOU spend studying, understanding the concepts and working on the exercises.

It only includes the duration of the video content.

That is good.

As for the content itself, it seems to include pretty much everything. Including topics that were not included in two interviews I had.

Which is very good.

Now, enough markdown. Time to work
