# Data Science interview preparation

What I should know to apply to DS positions
- Technical tools (languages)
- Theory knowledge (probability, statistics... )
- Machine learning
- Softwares

So these are the barebone requirements. As per the previous section, having some domain knowledge is also required, right? Otherwise, the position is ML Engineer?

## Tools of the trade

Basically which programming languages are needed.
Python and R are the main ones but depending on the application, knowing lower level languages (C++...) might be required.

Don't focus only on R and Python, having a good knowledge of SQL is also welcome and sometime necesarry.

Beyond languages, framework will also be necessary
- scikit-learn
- caret
- Spark
- specific libraries (pandas, numpy, ggplot, ...)

A JD requiring **Python** will also assume you are fluent in scikit-learn and other libraries. Think DS ecosystem more than just ticking the items off the list

Knowledge of software tools night also be required, especially for analyst positions

Strategy:
- Start with one language, learn it very well, then expand.

cf pragmatic programmer.
Be flexible and ready to learn.

## Theory knowledge

Actually more important than the coding skills.
Be ready to learn but need strong fundations.

Necessary starting points:
- calculus
- Linear algebra
- probability theory
- Statistics
  - Statistical inference
  - Distribution and descriptive statistics

Specific domains are also important:
- Graph and network theory (Yes! Need to continue working on that)
- Bayesian Statistics (Too many books on the topic on my book piles. Very few actually started)
- A/B Testing (been there, done that)

No need to be an expert in everything, know what and where to search for (*Aka, the summary of my engineering degree*)

## Machine Learning knowledge

Bare minimum:
- Bias Variance trade-off (Meh)
- Gradient descent (OK)
- L1/L2 regularization (nope)
- Bagging / boosting (first time reading these terms)

## Software engineering knowledge

- Algorithm and data structure
- Databases
- Distributed computing
- Data viz product or services
- domain specific knowledge

## How to know when I am ready to apply ?

Three bare minimums before applying:
- working knowledge of programming (current: working. Not great, but correct)
- knowledge of probability and statistics (should focus more on that)
  - can become a rabbit hole
  - Good yard stick: the questions in the course
- General knowledge of ML (did I spend too much time on that already ?)
  - have an understanding of the different machine learning algorithm
  - If ML engineer, it is expected to know much more.

Add some domain knowledge to that for good measure.
