# Data Science Interview Process

## Resumes

- Metrics (if you have them. Tougher in my positions)
- Tailor resume by positions (playing the number game means that it will not be possible to tailor each resume to each company). Only really tailor the resume you send to the company you really really really want.
  - Have a list of top 10-15 companies you WANT to apply to and prepare a resume for that
  - Prepare a resume focusing on
    - Product
    - ML
    - Business
    - (at the bare minimum)
- Have social proof
  - LinkedIn,
  - GitHub
  - blog
  - Kaggle
- Keep it 1 page

## Interview process

General process
1. Connection (=checking the resume)
2. Recruiter screening (is the position a good fit for you ?)
3. Technical screening
4. Take Home Task
5. On-site interview

## Landing Interviews

Shortage of good data scientists but MANY applicants.

So be ready to play the number game, especially for the very first Data scientist position. Once in place, you tend to receive offers naturally.

Application funnel:
- 100-200 Applications
- ...
- 5-10 onsites

5% conversion rate is quite good though!
