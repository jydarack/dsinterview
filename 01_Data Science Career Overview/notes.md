## Why a carreer in Data Science?

Huge impact by leveraging insights from mathematics and coding.

Not only big companies but many industries.

Plus a nice financial incentive

As for my reasons, well, theres a [blog post for that](https://ronin.achikochi.tokyo/datascience/2020/05/11/incentives.html)

This section was interesing:

> As a self test:
 - prepare an analysis and visualization of an unknown data set, while impatient stakeholders watch over your shoulder and ask pointed questions; be prepared to make quantitative arguments about the confidence of the results
 - describe “loss function” and “regularization term” each in 25 words or less, with a compare/contrast of several examples, and show how to structure a range of trade­offs for model transparency, predictive power, and resource requirements
 - pitch a reorg proposal to an executive staff session which implies firing some ranking people
 - interview 3­4 different departments that are hostile to your project, to tease out the metadata for datasets that they’ve been reluctant to release
 - build, test, and deploy a mission­-critical app with real­time SLAs, efficiently across a 1000+ node cluster
 - troubleshoot intermittent bugs in somebody else’s code which is at least 2000 lines long, without their assistance
 - leverage ensemble approaches to enhance a predictive model that you’re working on
 - work on a deadline in paired programming with people from 3­4 different fields completely disjoint from the work that you’ve done

Interesting in the sense that I am surprise by how many of these items I am doing or have already done...

>Circa 2012: that was then, this is now. Actual work in Data Science entails:
 some opportunities to innovate from a “greenfield” state, but not often
 mostly being called into an existing project — which is somehow at risk
 having to speak truth to power (not fun, but the essence of the role)

The second point is my current project. As for the third point, well, I have no idea in how many companies this is actually possible in Japan. Gaishikeis only? If power does not include Japanese members?

> From my perspective, the big issues in data now are not in ad­tech, but instead real issues: food supply, drought/flooding, energy security, health care, telecom, transportation apart from oil dependency, smarter manufacturing, deforestation monitoring, oceanographic analysis, etc. 

Great. I don't want to work in Adtech and I have had my dose of Bullshit jobs

> avoid Business Intelligence (like the plague)

Lol. Also: agreed.

## Data science is interdisciplinary

Classical DS Venn Diagram. I already know I'm skewed toward traditional research. Though I might have gotten better at computer science. Maybe. Ever so slightly?

## Positions and Titles

- Product analyst
- Business analyst *(my current position. Except the description given in the course is very different from what I'm doing. First: no data)*
- Machine Learning Engineer. Very technical
- Data Engineer
- Data scientist. Actual content depends on the company and project

## Education

Formal requirements = will require a formal degree in the field
Freelancing = degrees will become less important. Portfolio

> Choose your own path.

Depends on the country.
